@bmndr @github I wish there was a way not to grant extra access and beemind public activity only!
Hey @github, you used to be able to create labels on an issue page. Where'd that go? I almost never added new labels other ways.
@mikepilat @github the front page of the site admin panel has a basic match search and the big search box fuzzy searches users
Oh look, a bug in @github issues, if I had ¬£1 for every bug I'd found in github I'd have at least ¬£5 by now! I blame @timmow
