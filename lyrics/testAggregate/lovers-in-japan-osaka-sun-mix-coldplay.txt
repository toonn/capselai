 Lovers keep on the road your on  Runners until the race is run Soldiers you've got to soldier on  Sometimes even right is wrong They are turning my head out  To see what I'm all about  Keeping my head down  To see what it feels like now  But I have no doubt  One day, were gonna get out Tonight, maybe we're gonna run  Dreamin' of the Osaka sun Ohh, ohh, ohhh  Dreamin' of when the morning comes They are turning my head out  To see what I'm all about  Keeping my head down  To see what it feels like now  But I have no doubt  One day, the sun will come out Reign of love I can't let go To the sea I offer This heavy load Locusts will Lift me up I'm just a prisoner In a reign of love Locusts will Let us stop I wish I'd spoken To the reign of love Reign of love By the church, we?re waiting Reign of love My knees go praying How I wish I'd spoken up Or we'd be carried In the reign of love
