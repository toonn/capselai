 Go! The night's serenade again Suddenly you'll feel the rain wash away your pain Sin's the worst drug you've had You're whispering come out, come out Wherever you are! Intoxicating, looking at the stars At Lake Bodom slowly settle, into the darkened night. Making you want to take another swig. Making you feel like this is the last thing you'll ever drink! Fists in the air Their coming with despite  Their coming to destroy Spirits of Lake Bodom are furious again Something pass you by, you wait for you to know. At the Lake Bodom where you say your final goodbye! Soon you'll find your sat on the floor half a bottle deep, Swig your drink again until it goes away! Running out into the freezing waters  At the Lake Bodom where you once was drowned. Grab the bottle smash it on the rock! Feeling safer, no weapon, That's a big mistake! Lying down on the dock, Drift away to nightmare, There's bunch of sparks!
