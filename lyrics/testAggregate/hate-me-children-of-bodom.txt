I was born in ashes of molten hatred Raised by demons in abodes of the dead The Reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path Wrecked by mangled wounds of life I have become become the resurrection of the Evil one 'Y know that I don't fucking care if I live or die I need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins I despise everything I see so I don't give a fuck if ya hate me Ain't got respect for humanity Never lived or wanted immortality The Reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed You motherfuckers just leave me be Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside Led by the Reaper I walk in the night Show me the way to your kingdom come I believe in Armageddon, I've been baptised in alcohol I'm embodiment of Antichrist I'm living for my own demise
