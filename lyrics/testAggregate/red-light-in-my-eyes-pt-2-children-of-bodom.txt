 Pulling the last cry, I was alive (alive!) While I'm down in my hatred, weird, right (right!) Your god has set you on fire, this day the darkness light your way When we, reach this final dusk Bring me fire and insanity The jet-black eyes are showing butterflies, They dance in the fire insane, so [Chorus] Fire dance with me Fire come with me Fire your fire Of the everlasting flame, did burn me The one we are all off often struggling down, down, down, down And when you hear me forth to the ever last, Hear me used to bear dreams cast in a silent near Fire, you're killing me Fire, a thorn, sweet, so rare We'll praise the Lord to begin it Until the others will fall But, victims are we all We will at last destroy human gods And within us the fire is burning The dream lives forth, we're standing strong to fight And the everlasting fire is burning [Chorus]
