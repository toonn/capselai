Don't hear, don't deem Drowning before you dive Don't care, commit  To your self destruction drive I kiss the ground  With love beyond forever Flip off the sky  With bleeding fingers till I die Enemy, take one a good look at me Eradicate what you will always be Tainted flesh, polluted soul  Through a mirror I behold Throw a punch Shards bleed on the floor Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore Should I regret or ask myself Are you dead yet? Wake up, don't cry Regenerate to deny  The truth, the fiction  You leave a blindfold on your eyes Disclosure, self loathing This time you've gone too far Or could it be my nemesis  That you are? Enemy, take one good look at me Eradicate what you will always be Tainted flesh, polluted soul  Through a mirror I behold Throw a punch Shards bleed on the floor Tearing me apart but  I don't care anymore Should I regret or ask myself Are you dead yet? Enemy, take one a good look at me Eradicate what you will always be Tainted flesh, polluted soul  Through a mirror I behold Throw a punch Shards bleed the floor Tearing me apart but  I don't care anymore Should I regret or ask myself Are you dead yet? Are you dead yet?
