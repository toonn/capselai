[Spoken (continues from the previous track):] I want no one to escape. I hear the footsteps crawling by, Watching myself slowly die. Sharp pain is impaling through my heart, Slowly tearing me apart. One minute you're an angel fallen from grace, Next, the fist that I hate. Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss, Then rips out my heart to show me how black it is! No! Yet again... It feels so cold, It hollows your name. I'll die alone! I hear the footsteps walking by, Watching myself slowly die. Sharpening pain leading through my heart, Slowly tearing me apart. When you appear as an angel Look at me now, losing my way. Could you ever kill the pain in my heart Even though they say angels don't kill? No! Yet again... It feels so cold, It hollows your name. I'm dying alone! No! Yet again... It feels so cold, It hollows your name. I'll die alone!!
