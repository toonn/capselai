Watching the cunt But before I'm into worries I do better think fast Step beyond the legs Risk selfdestruction One more sucker Wait again To the wrong turn To the right direction Too many fucking gonna turn Going too fast When you call me outrageous As a questioner No feelings - you destroy me HATE We're welcome - we're on this show END What the hell was that? It's a battle name Tied down everything long before Blaming all the suckers I don't give fuck Till they're coming down Where I go Or he's gonna stop me And when I hear the voice So you better take care of me now Knowing that I've always gotta come back Till the end of life has arrived Things happen while I grow No one to catch my fall Becoming dull is all I know Resurrection - friend or a foe No feelings - you destroy me HATE We're welcome - we're on this show END Gone too fast I'm caring about the truth So tell me how Fuck me sideways I've been loved before right now After I've been down Well if you don't need to Resurrect a shadow of myself No feelings - you destroy me HATE We're welcome - we're on this show END No feelings - you destroy me HATE We're welcome - we're on this show Remember me, seventeen Come on, get you going Have I told you I would return Come on, get you going Gotta get on the way But the butcher You're allowed to lie I disapprove my body Eat my dinner You dull stupid role model Who's about to rock Things happen while I grow No one to catch my fall Becoming dull is all I know Resurrection - friend or a foe Friend or a foe
