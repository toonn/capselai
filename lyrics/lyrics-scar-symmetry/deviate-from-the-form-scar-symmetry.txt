 I transcend my earthly form Through some questions never asked before Question the need to be a machine That responds automatically Some words will trigger certain acts Just one of the commandments we have learnt Some acts will trigger certain states I think, it's time to alter the game I'm changing You're changing We're changing from within Deviate from the form of nothing Deviate from the norm to something Deviate from the form of nothing I deviate, farewell to the tribe I receive clues that lead me To answers never seen before And find the final piece In the puzzle of reality Some words will trigger certain acts Belief in limitations we have learnt Some acts will trigger certain states I'm taking back what I gave away I'm changing You're changing We're changing from within Deviate from the form of nothing Deviate from the norm to something Deviate from the form of nothing I deviate, farewell to the tribe Soul volcano, now erupting Lava swallows what used to be Soul tsunami, overflowing Overriding reality Soul volcano, now erupting Lava swallows what used to be Soul tsunami, overflowing Overriding reality Deviate from the form of nothing Deviate from the norm to something Deviate from the form of nothing I deviate, farewell to the tribe
