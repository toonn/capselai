 I've always known It is too late The signs burn deep in my soul End of the waiting comes; I'm taking my life I've always known it is too late I gladly reap what I sow  So now I bid you all farewell Blade in hand I do hesitate,  Terror can be read in my face  I keep forgetting that there is nothing to fear Caged inside  I cannot seem to end the battles Breaking down, I worship the insane I've always known it is too late The signs burn deep in my soul  End of the waiting comes  I'm taking my life I loathe all the things I see  What you feel doesn't matter to me  All these words and still there is nothing to hear Caged inside  I cannot seem to end the battles Breaking down, I worship the insane Churning, burning With frustration  Churning I am Turning, drowned in sickness  Twisting disease Swirling fever  And frustration  Vile infection Churning within  Burning conflicts  Enter death Caged inside  I cannot seem to end the battles Breaking down, I worship the insane Caged inside  This world knows its torture tactics  Born to pain but never again, no
