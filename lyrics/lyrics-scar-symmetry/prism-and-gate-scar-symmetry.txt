I'm submerged in filth, fragmented chaos In chrysalis state i await my birth Thoughts and memories proceed to haunt me Soon all these fragments will be gone Morphing begins I'm becoming a god Birth is nothing but death's beginning Now as my soul is yearning Morph to new paradigms Find wisdom in the learning My will always finds a way See the embers burning Sense no dividing line Same being, dead or living My will burns through time This being feeds within now To be born, be alive Feed inside Its presence goes beyond life Fate will follow the mind Birth is nothing but death's beginning Now as my soul is yearning Morph to new paradigms Find wisdom in the learning My will always finds a way See the embers burning Sense no dividing line Same being, dead or living My will burns through time This being feeds within now To be born, be alive Feed inside Its presence goes beyond life Fate will follow the mind Morphing complete Come forth emerging God Birth is nothing but death's beginning This being feeds within now To be born, be alive Feed inside Its presence goes beyond life Fate will follow the mind I am the one within now I'm the transforming tide
