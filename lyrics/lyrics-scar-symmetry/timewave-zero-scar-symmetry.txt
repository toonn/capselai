 All is gone now, atone Linear time overthrown When you find it's all a lie All worlds will die Time was all mine, I know Read the signs that I've shown If you read between the lines You'll know once the end comes Signs will arrive tonight Guiding light decrease my pain That I created on my own Blind be my eyes tonight Hide the sight that sees in vain Before and after is all done And everything is in time gone As I moved into worlds forsaken I saw things mankind can never own When we move on through minds awaken Die while you're alive and then you'll know Speak to mankind Through the raining light benign Signs will arrive tonight Guiding light decrease my pain That I created on my own Blind be my eyes tonight Hide the sight that sees in vain Before and after is all done And everything is in time gone Signs will arrive tonight Guiding light decrease my pain That I created on my own Blind be my eyes tonight Hide the sight that sees in vain Before and after is all done And everything is in time gone
