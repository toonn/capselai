 Darkness falls, light descending From the sky and towards the ground Electric presence Prolonged strobe flash  Bays of light Now shatters the night  Abstracted shape  Abstracted one High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest  One taken Lost to the skies Gone, taken away Five days absent The manhunt fails  None can explain The course of events Abstracted shape  Abstracted one High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest  Abducted soul Abducted mind Bright bolts of energy slays reality Abstracted shape Abstracted one High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest  Abducted soul Abducted mind Bright bolts of energy slays reality Departure Strange sights  Chaos within me Departure Bright lights I can't believe my eyes Darkness falls, light descending  From the sky and towards the ground
