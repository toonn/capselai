 All free will is gone  Automatic knowledge  Humans lead in leashes  Silent, untrue  All are subjects to  Automated liars  Broadcast feelings through  Machines that makes you  Wither away  Death of the soul  Indoctrinated in false grace  Bio-machinery  Mind and machinery  Fear now fuels the system  Bio-machinery  Target is the world  Structuring the madness  Terminating ancient  Concepts of truth  Power structure comes  Silent weapons fired  Quiet wars in minds  The damage is done  Wither away  Death of the soul  Indoctrinated in false grace  Bio-machinery  Mind and machinery  Fear now fuels the system  Bio-machinery  All hope that died must rise anew  By facing the passage of time  All that we've known was bound to drown  Before we could wake  Bio-machinery  Mind and machinery  Fear now fuels the system  Bio-machinery
