 As an outcast I paced defeat Seeking comfort in this painful retreat  Made an oracle against my will  Word spread of miraculous skills Premonitions call my name I once doubted them all when they came Now I embrace it and I'll never be the same Transfixed in the desert sands Take a look at my once empty hand See the rose that appears so real Just like the one you saw in your dreams Those who call me avatar Know not what they're looking for  They just feed their flames with miracles  Just so you know If you bathe within my light You diminish your own might The illusionist in everyone As an outcast I faced defeat Seeking comfort in this painful retreat  Made an oracle against my will  Word spread of miraculous skills Premonitions call my name I once doubted them all when they came Now I embrace it and I'll never be the same Those who call me avatar Know not what they're looking for  They just feed their flames with miracles Just so you know If you bathe within my light  You diminish your own might Illusionist in everyone What I say and what I do was once potential Sprung from the infinite place that dictates the seen Those who call me avatar Know not what they're looking for  They just feed their flames with miracles Just so you know If you bathe within my light  You diminish your own might Illusionist in everyone In everyone!
