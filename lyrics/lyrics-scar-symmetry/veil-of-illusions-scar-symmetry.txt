I focus upon this Considered real and true Within time, fixed it seems in form and space The dream is so real, as I participate From experienced reality there is no escape I interact in illusive reflections Internal mind perceptions Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real Slowly I realize, my eyes deceive me Nothing is what it seems to be The eyes perform a complex trickery Decoding numbers into imagery Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false I can feel the sorrow blinding all of this world Tear the veil to pieces And slip through the shreds [Solo] Should I close my eyes and depart End the beating of the heart Would I not wake from a lifelong dream Exposing the grandest of schemes Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false I can feel the sorrow blinding all of this world Tear the veil to pieces And slip through the shreds Embracing illusions The veil of illusions I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false
