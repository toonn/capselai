The path before you Never coming to a halt It stretches endlessly From here into the unknown Looking back You barely see through the fog What you were once, you are no more Each moment unique None exactly the same Defied, denied to live And exist like this again Now you will see you are reborn Arrive, arise to your new world As this one dies Forever death will embrace everything At dusk arrives The dark night of the soul Waiting to crush Every stone left unturned As you enter Go at least with this certainty You will emerge at dawn transformed Each moment unique None exactly the same Defied, denied to live And exist like this again Now you will see you are reborn Arrive, arise to your new world As this one dies Forever death will embrace everything All things end, none survives Every form must fade away [Solo] All things end, changing shape Waking to life again [Solo] Each moment unique None exactly the same Defied, denied to live And exist like this again Now you will see you are reborn Arrive, arise to your new world As this one dies Forever death will embrace everything 6. Veil Of Illusions I focus upon this Considered real and true Within time, fixed it seems in form and space The dream is so real, as I participate From experienced reality there is no escape I interact in illusive reflections Internal mind perceptions Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real Slowly I realize, my eyes deceive me Nothing is what it seems to be The eyes perform a complex trickery Decoding numbers into imagery Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false I can feel the sorrow blinding all of this world Tear the veil to pieces And slip through the shreds [Solo] Should I close my eyes and depart End the beating of the heart Would I not wake from a lifelong dream Exposing the grandest of schemes Embracing illusions Believing what I am shown The veil of illusions Pretending to be what is real I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false I can feel the sorrow blinding all of this world Tear the veil to pieces And slip through the shreds Embracing illusions The veil of illusions I touch only shadows, what I see is not real Lost in mere appearance, what I hear is false
