 Research, finding pathways in the seamless web In black spaces between worlds, a field unknown Repeat, endless mantras of the stored collective drone A surface world is what the senses show But you cannot taste the essence of your soul Sever all strings to the confined Forget all that has been Sever all strings to mortal life Unveil and see through With every thought you find a sequence has begun And when you trust your senses peace of mind will never come Through false sensory perceptions of the flesh You paint without colors on a canvas blank Deceived by the history on which we do bestow Based on the past we re-enact what's gone And when all else fails your essence will go on Sever all strings to the confined Forget all that has been Sever all strings to mortal life Unveil and see through With every thought you find a sequence has begun And when you trust your senses peace of mind will never come All that's been said and done is open to perceive In any way desired now behold, conflict is gone Whatever you find is never the truth Unless it doesn't die as time goes by Whatever you find, you just have to wait All things found will in time be gone Sever all strings to the confined Forget all that has been Sever all strings to mortal life Unveil and see through With every thought you find a sequence has begun And when you trust your senses peace of mind will never come All that's been said and done is open to perceive In any way desired now behold, conflict is gone
