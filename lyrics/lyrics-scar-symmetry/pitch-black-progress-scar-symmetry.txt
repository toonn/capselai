 This landscape mechanical  Well-oiled black machinery  Bio-driven computers Programmed for slave labour For slave labour! Structure made in urban design Kills the evolution of the mind I marching on a dead end path  With misplaced concentration It’s a pitch-black progress It’s a dead end process  It’s a pitch-black progress No more, no less Digital temples monitor the population Supplying the masses with what they see fit Programming digital dreams for the consumers A zombie nation devoid of improvisation Electro-hypnotic messages  Downloaded directly to the brain  Endless chanting subliminal  Hammers down the-will to resist  Progressing into a pitch black future  Leaving behind an analogue past  Promoting all op their new ways  Whatever the cost may be It’s a pitch-black progress It’s a dead end process  It’s a pitch-black progress No more, no less Introducing a pitch-black approach Taste the horns of the future Swallow the sulphur of the new order  To resist is to non-exist
