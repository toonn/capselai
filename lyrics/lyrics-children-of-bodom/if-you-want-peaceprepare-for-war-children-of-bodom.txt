Go! Yeow! Verse 1: Pain ain't really what you wanna be Five feet under seeing your humanity The oppritunity to divide The oppritunity of being apart!!! Rah! Verse 2: Soon be there, the moon in the sky tonight We're burning on a purified Smash your face and then I beat it down Are we really going to die?! Chourus: Get up and fight, release your rage, come on and fight Smashing your face, it is your fate, calling my name Calling me pain, and if you stay you'll bite the scythe Waiting for you I just want to tell you If you want peace... prepare for war Fuck! AWESOME SOLO!!!!!!!!!! Chorus again 2>
