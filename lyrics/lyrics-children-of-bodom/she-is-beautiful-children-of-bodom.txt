To tell you that I love you Don't know what to say Give everything I got to the beautiful girl The only thing I live for in the whole wide world [Chorus] She is beautiful She is beautiful She is beautiful She is beautiful The girl is beautiful I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) Going to throw it away And talk to you She looks good She looks good And it's true And it's true The girl is beautiful She is beautiful I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) When I'm living one time And I want you She looks good She looks good And it's true And it's true The girl is beautiful She is beautiful She is beautiful She is beautiful Na na na na na na na na She is beautiful She is beautiful Na na na na na na na na The girl is beautiful She is beautiful She is beautiful Na na na na na na na na She is beautiful She is beautiful Na na na na na na na na I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) Going to throw it away And talk to you She looks good She looks good And it's true And it's true The girl is beautiful She is beautiful I ain't got nothing to lose (Nothing to lose) And I'll never forget When I saw you She looks good She looks good And it's true And it's true The girl is beautiful She is beautiful
