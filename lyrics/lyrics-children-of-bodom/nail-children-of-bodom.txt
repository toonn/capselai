 Your eyes are full of hate, forty one, That's good Hate keeps a man alive, its gives him strength While cutting their shadows, kill them into the dark trough Black is all the way, furious never-ending darkness show Only way could be hard in their small and human nation I kill the first man, getting by death, we are God, through death [Chorus] Go, get up, victims that died Waiting for death, I should cry Take the farther off to cut your means, Listening up for afraid by means, They showed laughing me for my heart So they wake up these scythes, following me, Cold wind blow out, now to go, Let it go again with the scythes (Something wild!) It`s got the light, blow it out within you Never let the best shot come from fucking Avalon, that`s the one Time to feel my spirit, I gathered my souls Beat my night to kill them into my sin (doom, get up!) [Chorus] I can`t wait to for my heart I can`t get up, shadows, down (can't get up!) Set them along, time is right, far too along They wake me up (wake me up!)
