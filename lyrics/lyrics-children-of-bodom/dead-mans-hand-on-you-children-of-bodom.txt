 Walked a long long way down there Just to see, feel your glare I wanna sleep just drift away Mother Kali, just tuck me in, take me in Take me out Heaven, hell and the underworld Give me the white, the red and black It's all I ask, that's what I need If you let me love and be true blue I'll be more than just a dead man's hand on you Tell me lies won't be denied Mother Kali, will you be my bride? I'd paint your roses black and show you heaven Just to see your skin for one more second It's all I want that's what I do Love me one more time and I'll let you kill me too
