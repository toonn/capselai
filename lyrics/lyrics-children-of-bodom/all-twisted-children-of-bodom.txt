 When the damage is done and the words have been spoken I'm flat on the floor, left alone and broken Kill the bottle, beat the booze to the punch Kick the mirror in pieces, grab one break a bunch How did I get here? once again in a nightmare singing my refrain Is this my fate, was that my life I just saw flash before my eyes Saw a lot of smiles, felt tears of joy Oh the hope, all the life for me to destroy, Going up going down in a hole so small A rise followed by a free motherfuckin' fall I'm living with things all twisted Breathing in life I resisted This was my fate this is the world where I belong Don't know how long I've been gone Nor do I recall things I've done It just feels so wrong. It seems too good that I was always just misunderstood I'm living with now gone, dismissed. Forgotten faces once existed Laughing at my pride and singing my song I'm alive with things all twisted Breathing in life I resisted This was my fate, this is the world where I belong All twisted was my life is that so wrong?
