 Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy! Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch. Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin', [Chorus] Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels. Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn. A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens. [Chorus] Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band. Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo doo. Wond'rous apparition provided by magician. [Chorus] Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band. Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon? Doo, doo doo. Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrows. [Chorus] Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy! Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn. Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrows. [Chorus]
