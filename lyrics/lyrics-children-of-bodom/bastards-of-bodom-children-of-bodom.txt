 The slayings at Bodom from so long ago Still carry a secret, of which nobody knows A seed that was planted as the night turned to dawn Will now bring me to life as the Reaper's spawn I'm a bastard of Bodom and I walk alone As I follow the Reaper, to lead me back home My victims shall perish on the shores of this lake As they look upon me, to stare death in the face I don't need a reason, and I won't tell you why I'll just take you to hell by the edge of my scythe! I was born to end life, I can take any form  A shape shifting demon, killing for sport Like father, like son, this is my fate Taking your lives and breeding the hate!  I don't need a reason, and I won't tell you why I'll just take you to hell by the edge of my scythe!
