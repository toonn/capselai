 Let me get this one flat out straight Illuminate please it's not too late Since when did you become god? You might be right. I've been tattered 'N torn. self destructing since I was born So what's got to do with you? Close yet far - I've gone now Safe and sound - I don't know how Knuckled under - never giving up And it all goes to show exactly what? So much fun when you can tell me I'm dun Such a sweet unchaining sound Whisper me softly that I'm gonna die young Before you do take a look into the ground It's not my funeral If you rip my life apart in no time I'll put it back together in 2.5 How's that for punctuality? Since you wanna fuck me over And I know you do Better be aware I'm gonna fuck you too But you should by now be schooled in that very piece of my minds's obscurity
