 I feel so lost for me inside, lost am I, will it never end, but never am I stained black Now the end is drawing near, my hate is growing, can't you hear, it burns me with my cruelty (And I'm off) Like the fire of pain in the daylight Full of hate, your hatred gets up doom [Chorus] Hate, I can't control it anymore, you'll see the red light more and more Trapping you in destroying despite by the red light in my eyes So, better wake up, drink your blood, follow me and be a god Can't you fucking look into my eyes, watch this god arise, yeah (Come on!) I feel the last one in this time, lost am I, will it never end but never am I stained black, jet black Now walk away and flee into Hell, Turn away and meet my eyes. Under my, blood-red scythe! I can feel your hate of death, I'm running on this darkened little path Take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die (die!) [Chorus] Doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below, that's how the werewolf burns in me Oh God, I see the light again, I'm gonna be getting someone in my grave [Chorus]
