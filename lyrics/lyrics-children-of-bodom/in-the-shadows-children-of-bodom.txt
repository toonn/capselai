 I cannot get up by the howling cry Just justify my longing to die, Bury me down at last, I think about it in the shadows and cry! Can scissors heal a man torn of tears, A fading I fear inside. The reaper in sheet will stand by me I'm dreaming, I'm wearing a black dress that night! I'm just a being tonight, And still I'm dressed so black, oh yeah! Maybe I'm just blind, But maybe I should try Can't you see why the vision is calling you? I got the one, the dream of horror! Dreams of blood, dreams of war! Rudest eyes have seen the fright Welcome to the eternal night! You won't be a butcher No, you won't be at last Somebody's the trigger Take it off! What, you are the priest's son? So fuck So fuck yourself and die! Sill I stand against the death! Am I just a shade? Always I'm awake and in black! Sill I dare to praise the lord No I won't pass to the lord Goodbye, no So the keeper waits upon, He waits upon a border Let me own your punishment, It's time to break the border! The candlelight fades away There's nothing at all but me I stare at death and the darkest one's Watching me with cold eyes A god has been with me in the shadows I lost my reason to hate! ya! (So it's right) (I can leave the shadows!) (The last one has to survive!) Yaww! Wow, right! With my light shining bright I got my way, to regret? (just my hearts) With my last dying rhyme I got my world To betray for what I did by my motherfucking heart! The shadows draw back into honesty and love! Obey, and it will cut your throat I can't speak and you shan't be the next, The shadows strike in your blame, yaw!
