 Nightmare! Mass depression, silent screams out there Damn it, into darkness Something that'll never rise Darkness! In this something that the world that follows rhyme Impetrate, simplest wine Deep within my spine Silent Scream! Tearing it up in time It'll die sucking the part where it'll die Shout! Another time Evil hard knock game Mistake! Mistaken, something that's chewing you down Scared! Of dangers of light Bury tainted guy Grain... Suffers rhyme Hard is something that is destroyed Silent Scream! The worst of the bitterest sound Evil does the light turn into stow  Light! Free of dead Humanity mayday Destruction To the end show Preserved the nastiest prey Wake me up, and down Infinity to prey Selection to the later  It brought us the end of the day Nightmare! Mass depression, silent screams out there Damn it, into darkness Something that'll never rise Innocent! We're all gonna die! Silent scream! It's the end of light!
