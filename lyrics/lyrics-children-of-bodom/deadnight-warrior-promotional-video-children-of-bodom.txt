 Before the Daylight falls to rest,  Into shadows,  Soon I'll be on a black-night trip,  I'll fly across the sky.  It's not a lonely flight,  This one'll be black,  The death lies always in the sky,  It reflect hatred in my eyes.  If the daylight dies, the Shadow's are falling on me.  Then I'll be at your side,  Always in the moonlight shadow,  I can't get out,  Lost in time for eternity.  You're the guard of the dead ones,  In the night I'll find you to drink your blood,  You're the Dead night's fresh meat in my arms,  The dead by night's close by!  Don't wake it up, call my name, it's death!  Set them all on a trip of pain,  I can't wait!  It's such a lonely flight,  This one'll be black,  The death lies always in the sky,  It reflect hatred in my eyes.  It is such a pain to allow,  Being hard to wound  Always in the moonlight shadow  I can't get out!
