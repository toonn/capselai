 Just because I'm losing Doesn't mean I'm lost! Doesn't mean I'll stop Doesn't mean I will cross Just because I'm hurting Doesn't mean I'm hurt Doesn't mean I don't get what I deserved No better and no worse I just got lost Every river That I tried to cross Every door I ever tried was locked Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off You might be a big fish In a little pond Doesn't mean you've won 'Cause a long may come A bigger one And you'll be lost Every river That you tried to cross Every gun You ever held went off Oh and I'm just waiting Until the firing stopped Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off [Jay-Z] Aha, I gotcha, uh, With the same sword They knight you, They gon' good night you with Shit, That's only half If they like you That ain't even the half What they might do Don't believe me, ask Michael See Martin, see Malcolm See Biggie, see Pac, See success and its outcome See Jesus, see Judas See Caesar, see Brutus, See success is like suicide Suicide, it's a suicide If you succeed, Prepare to be crucified Media meddles, Niggas sue you, you settle Every step you take, They remind you You're ghetto So it's tough Being Bobby Brown To be Bobby then, You have to be Bobby now And the question is, 'Is to have had and lost Better Than not having at all?' Because I'm Oh and I, just waiting 'til the shine wears off Oh and I, just waiting 'til the shine wears off
