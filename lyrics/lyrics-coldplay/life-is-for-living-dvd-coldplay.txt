 Now I never meant, To do you wrong, That's what I came here to say. But if I was wrong, Then I'm sorry, I don't let it stand in our way. As my head just aches, When I think of, The things that I shouldn't have done. But, life is for living, We all know, And I don't want to live it alone. Sing, Ah, ah, oh, Sing, Ah, ah, oh, And just think, Ah, ah, oh.
