 There's a wild wind blowing Down the corner of my street Every night there, the headlights are glowing There's a cold war coming On the radio I heard Baby, it's a violent world Oh, love, don't let me go Won't you take me where the street lights glow I can hear it coming I can hear the silent sound Now my feet won't touch the ground Time came a creeping Oh and time's a loaded gun (Every road is a ray of light) It goes on Time only can lead you on, still it's Such a beautiful night Oh, love, don't let me go Won't you take me where the street lights glow I can hear it coming Like a serenade of sound Now my feet won't touch the ground Ooouuh ooouuuh Gravity, release me And don't ever hold me down Now my feet won't touch the ground
