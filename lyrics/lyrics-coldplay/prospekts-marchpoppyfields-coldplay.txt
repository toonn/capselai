 Smoke is rising from the houses People Burying their dead I ask somebody what the time is But time doesn't matter to them yet People talking without speaking Trying to take what they can get I ask you if you remember Propekt, how could I forget? Drums Here it comes Don't you wish that life could be as simple, As fish swimming round in a barrel. When you've got the gun? Oh and I'll run Here it comes We're just two little figures in a soup bowl Trying to get the anaconda control When I wasn't one Here I lie On my own in a separate sky Here I lie On my own in a separate sky I don't want to die On my own, here, tonight Here I lie On my own in a separate sky
