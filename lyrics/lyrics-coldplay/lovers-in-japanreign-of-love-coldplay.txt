 Lovers, keep on the road you're on Runners, until the race is run Soldiers, you've got to soldier on Sometimes even the right is wrong They are turning my head out To see what I'm all about Keeping my head down To see what it feels like now But I have no doubt One day, we're gonna get out Tonight maybe we're gonna run Dreaming of the Osaka sun Oh, oh, Dreaming of when the morning comes They are turning my head out To see what I'm all about Keeping my head down To see what it feels like now But I have no doubt One day the sun will come out Oh, Reign of love I can't let it go To the sea I offer This heavy load Locusts will Lift me up I'm just a prisoner In a reign of love Locusts will Let us stop I wish I'd spoken To the reign of love Reign of love By the church, we're waiting Reign of love My knees go praying How I wish I'd spoken up Or we'd be carried On the reign of love
